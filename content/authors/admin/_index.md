I am an aspiring theorist interested in all things mathematial and applied, with a recent focus on the interplay between quantum information and condensed matter physics. My research interests include procrastinating by building this website, existentialist philosophy and figuring out how to make money as a physicist (it's hard).  I am currently a student at CU Boulder and learning how to climb.
