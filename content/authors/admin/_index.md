I am an aspiring theorist/experimentalist mix with broad experiences and interests, with a recent focus on intersection of quantum computing and condensed matter physics. My research interests include procrastinating by building this website, statistical mechanics and figuring out how to make money as a physicist (it's hard).  I am currently applying to graduate school and would really love to attend your university.
