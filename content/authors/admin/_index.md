Mert Okyay is an aspiring theorist/experimentalist mix working on problems in a variery of disciplines, the most important being how annoying graduate school applications are. His research interests include procrastinating by building this website, statistical mechanics and how to make money as a physicist (it's hard).  He is currently applying to graduate school and would really love to attend your university.
