The summer of 2021 was dominated mainly by high inflation and constant changes in public health policy due to COVID-19 in Turkey. What kept me sane was my summer program work with Dr Ovgun and studying for the Physics GRE. Some might argue that standardized tests actually serve one otherwise but it was only a week of study, so I wouldn't worry. 

Our project on nonlinear electrodynamics was an extensive procedure of finding and deciding if results are interesting or not. The first issue was deciding what model we wanted to study. A suggestion was a recent model suggested by a collaborator of my advisor. Aside from being just another E&M model that attacks the issue of infinite self-energy, why study this Lagrangian?
