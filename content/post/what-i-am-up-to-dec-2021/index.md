As a physics undergraduate at U of Miami, with all classes completed and PhD applications done, what is there to do? 

The semester is proudly completed with a publication and all A's in my courses! Here is how is it going so far:

1. I lied a bit â€“ while main block of applications are due on Dec 15, there are a bunch due in January, that is still ongoing.
2. Our work on Heisenberg chain eigenstate preparation on quantum computers is nearing its end, expect a preprint soon! We have some exciting and some not-so-exciting results.
3. As no formal CMT class is offered at UM, I am taking advantage of the extra free time to complete the Oxford Solid State Basics Course. Planning to create a section on cool derivations and their history on this page! 

   1. Also, fingers crossed, the goal is to finish the degree strong with a work on crystals! This study serves as a basis for it. 
4. Some much needed rest time. With the last 3 and a half years, focused on finishing two STEM majors in 3 years and having at least one publication, it has been a long ride.
5. This website! It had been a looming goal on my mind to compile my work, CV and thoughts into one compact object, and with the extra time I am getting my hands dirty with this project. 
6. Have to take care of these boys:
