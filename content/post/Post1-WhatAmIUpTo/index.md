## Overview of my life right now

As a physics undergraduate at U of Miami(not really - I completed my physics major last year) that is applying to graduate school, life was tough this semester. Proud to say that it is done with all As, my paper is accepted for publication, and another one coming up - be on the lookout! So what do I do now?

1. Well, applications are not really done - most schools have deadlines at Dec 15 but there is a bunch on Jan 15, so still working on that.
2. My work on Heisenberg chain on quantum computers is coming along well - should soon be complete.
3. Studying Solid State Physics - no formal course offered at my Uni so I am studiying it myself using the Oxford Basics Course, I will be uploading some of the derivations here. This will hopefully lead to a work in piezoelectric crystals, fingers crossed!
4. Honestly, much needed rest. It was a tough semester with COVID-19 and all the other responsibilities, and one wants to relax their mind every once in a while. 
5. Getting to build this website! It is really fun to put some sort of an online profile.
