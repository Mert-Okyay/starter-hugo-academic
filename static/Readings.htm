          Colloquium: Quantum and classical discrete time crystals

          The spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry has led to the discovery of a new phase of matter: the discrete time crystal. Discrete time crystals exhibit rigid subharmonic oscillations that result from a combination of many-body interactions, collective synchronization, and ergodicity breaking. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in the study of quantum and classical discrete time crystals. The breaking of ergodicity is focused upon as the key to discrete time crystals and the delaying of ergodicity as the source of numerous phenomena that share many of the properties of discrete time crystals, including the ac Josephson effect, coupled map lattices, and Faraday waves. Theoretically, there is a diverse array of strategies to stabilize time-crystalline order in both closed and open systems, ranging from localization and prethermalization to dissipation and error correction. Experimentally, many-body quantum simulators provide a natural platform for investigating signatures of time-crystalline order; recent work utilizing trapped ions, solid-state spin systems, and superconducting qubits are reviewed. Finally, this Colloquium concludes by describing outstanding challenges in the field and a vision for new directions on both the experimental and theoretical fronts.

        <p>
          Recent years have seen tremendous progress in the theoretical understanding of quantum systems driven dissipatively by coupling to different baths at their edges. This was possible because of concurrent advances in the models used to represent these systems, the methods employed, and the analysis of the emerging phenomenology. A comprehensive review of these three integrated research directions is given. First provided is an overarching view of the models of boundary-driven open quantum systems, in both the weak- and strong-coupling regimes. This is followed by a review of state-of-the-art analytical and numerical methods that are exact, perturbative, and approximate. Finally, the transport properties of some paradigmatic one-dimensional chains are discussed, with an emphasis on disordered and quasiperiodic systems, the emergence of rectification and negative differential conductance, and the role of phase transitions, and an outlook on further research options is given.

          Finite-temperature transport in one-dimensional quantum lattice models

          Over the last decade impressive progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of transport properties of clean, one-dimensional quantum lattice systems. Many physically relevant models in one dimension are Bethe-ansatz integrable, including the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg (also called the spin-1/2 ùëãùëãùëç chain) and the Fermi-Hubbard model. Nevertheless, practical computations of correlation functions and transport coefficients pose hard problems from both the conceptual and technical points of view. Only because of recent progress in the theory of integrable systems, on the one hand, and the development of numerical methods, on the other hand, has it become possible to compute their finite-temperature and nonequilibrium transport properties quantitatively. Owing to the discovery of a novel class of quasilocal conserved quantities, there is now a qualitative understanding of the origin of ballistic finite-temperature transport, and even diffusive or superdiffusive subleading corrections, in integrable lattice models. The current understanding of transport in one-dimensional lattice models, in particular, in the paradigmatic example of the spin-1/2 ùëãùëãùëç and Fermi-Hubbard models, is reviewed, as well as state-of-the-art theoretical methods, including both analytical and computational approaches. Among other novel techniques, matrix-product-state-based simulation methods, dynamical typicality, and, in particular, generalized hydrodynamics are covered. The close and fruitful connection between theoretical models and recent experiments is discussed, with examples given from the realms of both quantum magnets and ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices.

        A Lanczos approach to the Adiabatic Gauge Potential
      </a>
      <br>
      Budhaditya Bhattacharjee
      <p>
        The Adiabatic Gauge Potential (AGP) is the generator of adiabatic deformations between quantum eigenstates. There are many ways to construct the AGP operator and evaluate the AGP norm. Recently, it was proposed that a Gram-Schmidt-type algorithm can be used to explicitly evaluate the expression of the AGP. We employ a version of this approach by using the Lanczos algorithm to evaluate the AGP operator in terms of Krylov vectors and the AGP norm in terms of the Lanczos coefficients. It has the advantage of minimizing redundancies in evaluating the nested commutators in the analytic expression for the AGP operator. The algorithm is used to explicitly construct the AGP operator for some simple systems. We derive an integral transform relation between the AGP norm and the autocorrelation function of the deformation operator. We present a modification of the Variational approach to derive the regulated AGP norm. Using this, we approximate the AGP to varying degrees of success. Finally, we compare and contrast the quantum-chaos-probing capacities of the AGP and K-complexity in view of the Operator Growth Hypothesis.

        Adiabatic Eigenstate Deformations as a Sensitive Probe for Quantum Chaos      </a>
      <br>
      Mohit Pandey, Pieter W. Claeys, David K. Campbell, Anatoli Polkovnikov, and Dries Sels
      <p>
        In the past decades, it was recognized that quantum chaos, which is essential for the emergence of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, manifests itself in the effective description of the eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltonians through random matrix ensembles and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Standard measures of chaos in quantum many-body systems are level statistics and the spectral form factor. In this work, we show that the norm of the adiabatic gauge potential, the generator of adiabatic deformations between eigenstates, serves as a much more sensitive measure of quantum chaos. We are able to detect transitions from integrable to chaotic behavior at perturbation strengths orders of magnitude smaller than those required for standard measures. Using this alternative probe in two generic classes of spin chains, we show that the chaotic threshold decreases exponentially with system size and that one can immediately detect integrability-breaking (chaotic) perturbations by analyzing infinitesimal perturbations even at the integrable point. In some cases, small integrability breaking is shown to lead to anomalously slow relaxation of the system, exponentially long in system size.

        Adiabatic gauge potential and integrability breaking with
        free fermions

      <br>
      Bal√°zs Pozsgay, Rustem Sharipov, Anastasiia Tiutiakina, Istv√°n Vona
      <p>
        We revisit the problem of integrability breaking in free fermionic quantum spin chains. We investigate the so-called adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), which was recently proposed as an accurate probe of quantum chaos. We also study the so-called weak integrability breaking, which occurs if the dynamical effects of the perturbation do not appear at leading order in the perturbing parameter. A recent statement in the literature claimed that integrability breaking should generally lead to an exponential growth of the AGP norm with respect to the volume. However, afterwards it was found that weak integrability breaking is a counter-example, leading to a cross-over between polynomial and exponential growth. Here we show that in free fermionic systems the AGP norm always grows polynomially, if the perturbation is local with respect to the fermions, even if the perturbation strongly breaks integrability. As a by-product of our computations we also find, that in free fermionic spin chains there are operators which weakly break integrability, but which are not associated with known long range deformations.

      <p>
        For quantum computers to successfully solve real-world problems, it is necessary to tackle the challenge of noise: the errors that occur in elementary physical components due to unwanted or imperfect interactions. The theory of quantum fault tolerance can provide an answer in the long term, but in the coming era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum machines one must seek to mitigate errors rather than completely eliminate them. This review surveys the diverse methods that have been proposed for quantum error mitigation, assesses their in-principle efficacy, and describes the hardware demonstrations achieved to date. Commonalities and limitations among the methods are identified, while mention is made of how mitigation methods can be chosen according to the primary type of noise present, including algorithmic errors. Open problems in the field are identified, and the prospects for realizing mitigation-based devices that can deliver a quantum advantage with an impact on science and business are discussed.

        Atomtronics is an emerging field that aims to manipulate ultracold atom moving in matter-wave circuits for fundamental studies in both quantum science and technological applications. In this Colloquium, recent progress in matter-wave circuitry and atomtronics-based quantum technology is reviewed. After an introduction to the basic physical principles and the key experimental techniques needed to realize atomtronic systems, the physics of matter waves in simple circuits such as ring traps and two-terminal systems is described. The main experimental observations and outstanding questions are discussed. Also presented are possible applications to a broad range of quantum technologies, from quantum sensing with atom interferometry to future quantum simulation and quantum computation architectures.

        Some measurements in quantum mechanics disturb each other. This has puzzled physicists since the formulation of the theory, but only in recent decades has the incompatibility of measurements been analyzed in depth and detail, using the notion of joint measurability of generalized measurements. In this Colloquium joint measurability and incompatibility are reviewed from the perspective of quantum information science. The Colloquium starts by discussing the basic definitions and concepts. An overview on applications of incompatibility, such as in measurement uncertainty relations, the characterization of quantum correlations, or information processing tasks like quantum state discrimination, is then presented. Finally, emerging directions of research, such as a resource theory of incompatibility as well as other concepts to grasp the nature of measurements in quantum mechanics, are discussed.

        In this review recent investigations are summarized of many-body quantum systems with long-range interactions, which are currently realized in Rydberg atom arrays, dipolar systems, trapped-ion setups, and cold atoms in cavities. In these experimental platforms parameters can be easily changed, and control of the range of the interaction has been achieved. The main aim of the review is to present and identify the common and mostly universal features induced by long-range interactions in the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Discussed are the case of strong nonlocal couplings, i.e., the nonadditive regime, and the one in which energy is extensive, but low-energy, long-wavelength properties are altered with respect to the short-range case. When possible, comparisons with the corresponding results for classical systems are presented. Finally, cases of competition with local effects are also reviewed.

        Colloquium: Anomalous statistics of laser-cooled atoms in dissipative optical lattices

      <p>
        Diffusion occurs in numerous physical systems throughout nature, drawing its generality from the universality of the central limit theorem. Approximately a century ago it was realized that an extension to this type of dynamics can be obtained in the form of ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù diffusion, where distributions are allowed to have heavy power-law tails. Owing to a unique feature of its momentum-dependent dissipative friction force, laser-cooled atomic ensembles can be used as a test bed for such dynamics. The interplay between laser cooling and anomalous dynamics bears deep predictive implications for fundamental concepts in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics. The high degree of control available in cold-atom experiments allows for the parameters of the friction to be tuned, revealing transitions in the dynamical properties of the system. Rare events in both the momentum and spatial distributions are described by non-normalized states using tools adapted from infinite ergodic theory. This leads to new experimental and theoretical results that illuminate the various features of the system.

        The current understanding of the role of topology in non-Hermitian (NH) systems and its far-reaching physical consequences observable in a range of dissipative settings are reviewed. In particular, how the paramount and genuinely NH concept of exceptional degeneracies, at which both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, leads to phenomena drastically distinct from the familiar Hermitian realm is discussed. An immediate consequence is the ubiquitous occurrence of nodal NH topological phases with concomitant open Fermi-Seifert surfaces, where conventional band-touching points are replaced by the aforementioned exceptional degeneracies. Furthermore, new notions of gapped phases including topological phases in single-band systems are detailed, and the manner in which a given physical context may affect the symmetry-based topological classification is clarified. A unique property of NH systems with relevance beyond the field of topological phases consists of the anomalous relation between bulk and boundary physics, stemming from the striking sensitivity of NH matrices to boundary conditions. Unifying several complementary insights recently reported in this context, a picture of intriguing phenomena such as the NH bulk-boundary correspondence and the NH skin effect is put together. Finally, applications of NH topology in both classical systems including optical setups with gain and loss, electric circuits, and mechanical systems and genuine quantum systems such as electronic transport settings at material junctions and dissipative cold-atom setups are reviewed.

      <p>
        Quantum-mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in Josephson-junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980s. In recent decades, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly and controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic fields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to gate-based digital quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED provides a framework for the study of hybrid quantum systems, such as quantum dots, magnons, Rydberg atoms, surface acoustic waves, and mechanical systems interacting with microwave photons. Here the coherent coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focusing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system are reviewed. Also discussed is coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, important use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics are discussed. Circuit QED realizes a broad set of concepts that open up new possibilities for the study of quantum physics at the macro scale with superconducting circuits and applications to quantum information science in the widest sense.

        The theory of entanglement provides a fundamentally new language for describing interactions and correlations in many-body systems. Its vocabulary consists of qubits and entangled pairs, and the syntax is provided by tensor networks. How matrix product states and projected entangled pair states describe many-body wave functions in terms of local tensors is reviewed. These tensors express how the entanglement is routed, act as a novel type of nonlocal order parameter, and the manner in which their symmetries are reflections of the global entanglement patterns in the full system is described. The manner in which tensor networks enable the construction of real-space renormalization group flows and fixed points is discussed, and the entanglement structure of states exhibiting topological quantum order is examined. Finally, a summary of the mathematical results of matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, highlighting the fundamental theorem of matrix product vectors and its applications, is provided.

      <p>
        Recent progress in utilizing ultrafast light-matter interaction to control the macroscopic properties of quantum materials is reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on photoinduced phenomena that do not result from ultrafast heating effects but rather emerge from microscopic processes that are inherently nonthermal in nature. Many of these processes can be described as transient modifications to the free energy landscape resulting from the redistribution of quasiparticle populations, the dynamical modification of coupling strengths, and the resonant driving of the crystal lattice. Other pathways result from the coherent dressing of a material‚Äôs quantum states by the light field. A selection of recently discovered effects leveraging these mechanisms, as well as the technological advances that led to their discovery, is discussed. A road map for how the field can harness these nonthermal pathways to create new functionalities is presented.

        Colloquium: Protecting quantum information against environmental noise      </a>
      <br>
      Dieter Suter and Gonzalo A. √Ålvarez
      <p>
        Quantum technologies represent a rapidly evolving field in which the specific properties of quantum mechanical systems are exploited to enhance the performance of various applications such as sensing, transmission, and processing of information. Such devices can be useful only if the quantum systems also interact with their environment. However, the interactions with the environment can degrade the specific quantum properties of these systems, such as coherence and entanglement. It is therefore essential that the interaction between a quantum system and the environment is controlled in such a way that the unwanted effects of the environment are suppressed while the necessary interactions are retained. This Colloquium gives an overview, aimed at newcomers to this field, of some of the challenges that need to be overcome to achieve this goal. A number of techniques have been developed for this purpose in different areas of physics including magnetic resonance, optics, and quantum information. They include the application of static or time-dependent fields to the quantum system, which are designed to average the effect of the environmental interactions to zero. Quantum error correction schemes were developed to detect and eliminate certain errors that occur during the storage and processing of quantum information. In many physical systems, it is useful to use specific quantum states that are intrinsically less susceptible to environmental noise for encoding the quantum information. The dominant contribution to the loss of information is pure dephasing, i.e., through the loss of coherence in quantum mechanical superposition states. Accordingly, most schemes for reducing loss of information focus on dephasing processes. This is also the focus of this Colloquium.

      Universal few-body physics and cluster formation
      </a>
      <br>

      <p>
        A recent rejuvenation of experimental and theoretical interest in the physics of few-body systems has provided deep, fundamental insights into a broad range of problems. Few-body physics is a cross-cutting discipline not restricted to conventional subject areas such as nuclear physics or atomic or molecular physics. To a large degree, the recent explosion of interest in this subject has been sparked by dramatic enhancements of experimental capabilities in ultracold atomic systems over the past decade, which now permit atoms and molecules to be explored deep in the quantum mechanical limit with controllable two-body interactions. This control, typically enabled by magnetic or electromagnetically dressed Fano-Feshbach resonances, allows, in particular, access to the range of universal few-body physics, where two-body scattering lengths far exceed all other length scales in the problem. The Efimov effect, where three particles experiencing short-range interactions can counterintuitively exhibit an infinite number of bound or quasibound energy levels, is the most famous example of universality. Tremendous progress in the field of universal Efimov physics has taken off, driven particularly by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies in the past decade, and prior to the first observation in 2006, by an extensive set of theoretical studies dating back to 1970. Because experimental observations of Efimov physics have usually relied on resonances or interference phenomena in three-body recombination, this connects naturally with the processes of molecule formation in a low-temperature gas of atoms or nucleons, and more generally with ùëÅ-body recombination processes. Some other topics not closely related to the Efimov effect are also reviewed in this article, including confinement-induced resonances for explorations of lower-dimensionality systems, and some chemically interesting systems with longer-range forces such as the ion-atom-atom recombination problem.

        ‚ÄúQuantum sensing‚Äù describes the use of a quantum system, quantum properties, or quantum phenomena to perform a measurement of a physical quantity. Historical examples of quantum sensors include magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices and atomic vapors or atomic clocks. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology, with the most common platforms being spin qubits, trapped ions, and flux qubits. The field is expected to provide new opportunities‚Äîespecially with regard to high sensitivity and precision‚Äîin applied physics and other areas of science. This review provides an introduction to the basic principles, methods, and concepts of quantum sensing from the viewpoint of the interested experimentalist.

        Large-scale quantum effects have always played an important role in the foundations of quantum theory. With recent experimental progress and the aspiration for quantum enhanced applications, the interest in macroscopic quantum effects has been reinforced. In this review, measures aiming to quantify various aspects of macroscopic quantumness are critically analyzed and discussed. Recent results on the difficulties and prospects to create, maintain, and detect macroscopic quantum states are surveyed. The role of macroscopic quantum states in foundational questions as well as practical applications is outlined. Finally, past and ongoing experimental advances aiming to generate and observe macroscopic quantum states are presented.

        Quantum-enhanced measurements without entanglement

        Quantum-enhanced measurements exploit quantum mechanical effects for increasing the sensitivity of measurements of certain physical parameters and have great potential for both fundamental science and concrete applications. Most of the research has so far focused on using highly entangled states, which are, however, difficult to produce and to stabilize for a large number of constituents. In the following alternative mechanisms are reviewed, notably the use of more general quantum correlations such as quantum discord, identical particles, or nontrivial Hamiltonians; the estimation of thermodynamical parameters or parameters characterizing nonequilibrium states; and the use of quantum phase transitions. Both theoretically achievable enhancements and enhanced sensitivities not primarily based on entanglement that have already been demonstrated experimentally and indicate some possible future research directions are described.

        Quantum technologies exploit entanglement to revolutionize computing, measurements, and communications. This has stimulated the research in different areas of physics to engineer and manipulate fragile many-particle entangled states. Progress has been particularly rapid for atoms. Thanks to the large and tunable nonlinearities and the well-developed techniques for trapping, controlling, and counting, many groundbreaking experiments have demonstrated the generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold, and ultracold gases of neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can strongly couple to external forces and fields, which makes them ideal for ultraprecise sensing and time keeping. All these factors call for generating nonclassical atomic states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity of precision measurements. The goal of this article is to review and illustrate the theory and the experiments with atomic ensembles that have demonstrated many-particle entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology.

        Quantum resource theories
      </a>
      <br>
      Eric Chitambar and Gilad Gour
      <p>
        Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a highly versatile and powerful framework for studying different phenomena in quantum physics. From quantum entanglement to quantum computation, resource theories can be used to quantify a desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection, and identify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly, QRTs have revolutionized the way we think about familiar properties of physical systems such as entanglement, elevating them from being just interesting fundamental phenomena to being useful in performing practical tasks. The basic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states into two groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of resource states. Accompanying the set of free states is a collection of free quantum operations arising from natural restrictions placed on the physical system, restrictions that force the free operations to act invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what information processing tasks become possible using the restricted operations. Despite the large degree of freedom in how one defines the free states and free operations, unexpected similarities emerge among different QRTs in terms of resource measures and resource convertibility. As a result, objects that appear quite distinct on the surface, such as entanglement and quantum reference frames, appear to have great similarity on a deeper structural level. This article reviews the general framework of a quantum resource theory, focusing on common structural features, operational tasks, and resource measures. To illustrate these concepts, an overview is provided on some of the more commonly studied QRTs in the literature.

        Quantum steering

      <br>

      <p>
        Quantum correlations between two parties are essential for the argument of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in favor of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics. Schr√∂dinger noted that an essential point is the fact that one party can influence the wave function of the other party by performing suitable measurements. He called this phenomenon quantum steering and studied its properties, but only in recent years has this kind of quantum correlation attracted significant interest in quantum information theory. In this paper, the theory of quantum steering is reviewed. First, the basic concepts of steering and local hidden state models are presented and their relation to entanglement and Bell nonlocality is explained. Then various criteria for characterizing steerability and structural results on the phenomenon are described. A detailed discussion is given on the connections between steering and incompatibility of quantum measurements. Finally, applications of steering in quantum information processing and further related topics are reviewed.

        Irreversible entropy production: From classical to quantum
      </a>
      <br>
      Gabriel T. Landi and Mauro Paternostro
      <p>
        Entropy production is a key quantity in any finite-time thermodynamic process. It is intimately tied with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics, embodying a tool to extend thermodynamic considerations all the way to nonequilibrium processes. It is also often used in attempts to provide the quantitative characterization of logical and thermodynamic irreversibility, stemming from processes in physics, chemistry, and biology. Notwithstanding its fundamental character, a unifying theory of entropy production valid for general processes, both classical and quantum, has not yet been formulated. Developments pivoting around the frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, open quantum systems, and quantum information theory have led to substantial progress in such endeavors. This has culminated in the unlocking of a new generation of experiments able to address stochastic thermodynamic processes and the impact of entropy production on them. This review aims to provide a compendium on the current framework for the description, assessment, and manipulation of entropy production. Formal aspects of its formulation and the implications stemming from the potential quantum nature of a given process, including a detailed survey of recent experiments, are both presented.

        Quantum spin liquid states
      </a>
      <br>
      Yi Zhou, Kazushi Kanoda, and Tai-Kai Ng
      <p>
        This is an introductory review of the physics of quantum spin liquid states. Quantum magnetism is a rapidly evolving field, and recent developments reveal that the ground states and low-energy physics of frustrated spin systems may develop many exotic behaviors once we leave the regime of semiclassical approaches. The purpose of this article is to introduce these developments. The article begins by explaining how semiclassical approaches fail once quantum mechanics become important and then describe the alternative approaches for addressing the problem. Mainly spin-1/2 systems are discussed, and most of the time is spent in this article on one particular set of plausible spin liquid states in which spins are represented by fermions. These states are spin-singlet states and may be viewed as an extension of Fermi liquid states to Mott insulators, and they are usually classified in the category of so-called ùëÜ‚Å¢ùëà‚Å°(2), ùëà‚Å°(1), or ùëç2 spin liquid states. A review is given of the basic theory regarding these states and the extensions of these states to include the effect of spin-orbit coupling and to higher spin (ùëÜ>1/2) systems. Two other important approaches with strong influences on the understanding of spin liquid states are also introduced: (i) matrix product states and projected entangled pair states and (ii) the Kitaev honeycomb model. Experimental progress concerning spin liquid states in realistic materials, including anisotropic triangular-lattice systems [ùúÖ‚àí(ET)2‚Å¢Cu2‚Å¢(CN)3 and EtMe3‚Å¢Sb‚Å¢[Pd‚Å¢(dmit)2]2], kagome-lattice system [ZnCu3‚Å¢(OH)6‚Å¢Cl2], and hyperkagome lattice system (Na4‚Å¢Ir3‚Å¢O8), is reviewed and compared against the corresponding theories.

      <p>
        What are topological phases of matter? First, they are phases of matter at zero temperature. Second, they have a nonzero energy gap for the excitations above the ground state. Third, they are disordered liquids that seem to have no feature. But those disordered liquids actually can have rich patterns of many-body entanglement representing new kinds of order. This Colloquium gives a simple introduction and a brief survey of topological phases of matter. First topological phases with topological order (i.e., with long-range entanglement) are discussed. Then topological phases without topological order (i.e., with short-range entanglement) are covered.      </p>

        Colloquium: Many-body localization, thermalization, and entanglement

        Thermalizing quantum systems are conventionally described by statistical mechanics at equilibrium. However, not all systems fall into this category, with many-body localization providing a generic mechanism for thermalization to fail in strongly disordered systems. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators at nonzero temperature, which do not thermalize and therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and nonequilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of quasilocal integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on quasilocal integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore, MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. An outline is given of the current theoretical understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic phases and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition. Experimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well isolated from an external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL phase. Recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in which different signatures of many-body localization have been observed, are reviewed. This Colloquium concludes by listing outstanding challenges and promising future research directions.

      <p>
        Life is characterized by a myriad of complex dynamic processes allowing organisms to grow, reproduce, and evolve. Physical approaches for describing systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium have been increasingly applied to living systems, which often exhibit phenomena not found in those traditionally studied in physics. Spectacular advances in experimentation during the last decade or two, for example, in microscopy, single-cell dynamics, in the reconstruction of subcellular and multicellular systems outside of living organisms, and in high throughput data acquisition, have yielded an unprecedented wealth of data on cell dynamics, genetic regulation, and organismal development. These data have motivated the development and refinement of concepts and tools to dissect the physical mechanisms underlying biological processes. Notably, landscape and flux theory as well as active hydrodynamic gel theory have proven useful in this endeavor. Together with concepts and tools developed in other areas of nonequilibrium physics, significant progress has been made in unraveling the principles underlying efficient energy transport in photosynthesis, cellular regulatory networks, cellular movements and organization, embryonic development and cancer, neural network dynamics, population dynamics and ecology, as well as aging, immune responses, and evolution. Here recent advances in nonequilibrium physics are reviewd and their application to biological systems is surveyed. Many of these results are expected to be important cornerstones as the field continues to build our understanding of life.

      Shortcuts to adiabaticity: Concepts, methods, and applications

      <p>
        Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) are fast routes to the final results of slow, adiabatic changes of the controlling parameters of a system. The shortcuts are designed by a set of analytical and numerical methods suitable for different systems and conditions. A motivation to apply STA methods to quantum systems is to manipulate them on timescales shorter than decoherence times. Thus shortcuts to adiabaticity have become instrumental in preparing and driving internal and motional states in atomic, molecular, and solid-state physics. Applications range from information transfer and processing based on gates or analog paradigms to interferometry and metrology. The multiplicity of STA paths for the controlling parameters may be used to enhance robustness versus noise and perturbations or to optimize relevant variables. Since adiabaticity is a widespread phenomenon, STA methods also extended beyond the quantum world to optical devices, classical mechanical systems, and statistical physics. Shortcuts to adiabaticity combine well with other concepts and techniques, in particular, with optimal control theory, and pose fundamental scientific and engineering questions such as finding speed limits, quantifying the third law, or determining process energy costs and efficiencies. Concepts, methods, and applications of shortcuts to adiabaticity are reviewed and promising prospects are outlined, as well as open questions and challenges ahead.

      Colloquium: Statistical mechanics and thermodynamics at strong coupling: Quantum and classical

      <p>
        The statistical mechanical description of small systems staying in thermal equilibrium with an environment can be achieved by means of the Hamiltonian of mean force. In contrast to the reduced density matrix of an open quantum system, or the reduced phase-space probability density function of a classical open system, the Hamiltonian of mean force not only characterizes the reduced state but also contains full information about the thermodynamics of the considered open system. The resulting thermodynamic potentials all assume the form as the difference of the potentials for the total system and the bare environment in the absence of the system. In contrast to work as a mechanical notion, one faces several problems with the definition of heat, which turns out to be largely ambiguous in the case of strong coupling between system and environment. The general theory of the thermodynamics of open systems, in particular, in view of strong coupling, is reviewed and illustrated it with several examples. The vagueness of heat is discussed in the context of the ambiguities in the definitions of a fluctuating internal energy and other fluctuating thermodynamic potentials.

        How do closed quantum many-body systems driven out of equilibrium eventually achieve equilibration? And how do these systems thermalize, given that they comprise so many degrees of freedom? Progress in answering these‚Äîand related‚Äîquestions has accelerated in recent years‚Äîa trend that can be partially attributed to success with experiments performing quantum simulations using ultracold atoms and trapped ions. Here we provide an overview of this progress, specifically in studies probing dynamical equilibration and thermalization of systems driven out of equilibrium by quenches, ramps and periodic driving. In doing so, we also address topics such as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, typicality, transport, many-body localization and universality near phase transitions, as well as future prospects for quantum simulation.

Focusing on prethermalization and universal dynamics following a quench, we describe the experiments with ultracold atomic gases that illustrate these phenomena and summarize the essential theoretical concepts employed to interpret them. Our discussion highlights the key topics that link the different approaches to this interdisciplinary field, including the generalized Gibbs ensemble, non-thermal fixed points, critical slowing and universal scaling. Finally, we point to new experimental challenges demonstrating these fundamental features of many-body quantum systems out of equilibrium.

        Implications of gauge freedom for nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics
      </a>
      <br>
      Adam Stokes and Ahsan Nazir
      <p>
        Gauge freedom in quantum electrodynamics (QED) outside of textbook regimes is reviewed. It is emphasized that QED subsystems are defined relative to a choice of gauge. Each definition uses different gauge-invariant observables. This relativity is eliminated only if a sufficient number of Markovian and weak-coupling approximations are employed. All physical predictions are gauge invariant, including subsystem properties such as photon number and entanglement. However, subsystem properties naturally differ for different physical subsystems. Gauge ambiguities arise not because it is unclear how to obtain gauge-invariant predictions, but because it is not always clear which physical observables are the most operationally relevant. The gauge invariance of a prediction is necessary but not sufficient to ensure its operational relevance. It is shown that, in controlling which gauge-invariant observables are used to define a material system, the choice of gauge affects the balance between the material system‚Äôs localization and its electromagnetic dressing. Various implications of subsystem gauge relativity for deriving effective models, for describing time-dependent interactions, for photodetection theory, and for describing matter within a cavity are reviewed.

The review shows how the method for computing gravitational fine-grained entropy, developed over the past 15 years, can be extended to capture the entropy of Hawking radiation. This technique reveals large corrections needed for the entropy to be consistent with unitary black hole evaporation.

      <p>
        Entanglement entropy plays a variety of roles in quantum field theory, including the connections between quantum states and gravitation through the holographic principle. This article provides a review of entanglement entropy from a mixed viewpoint of field theory and holography. A set of basic methods for the computation is developed and illustrated with simple examples such as free theories and conformal field theories. The structures of the ultraviolet divergences and the universal parts are determined and compared with the holographic descriptions of entanglement entropy. The utility of quantum inequalities of entanglement are discussed and shown to derive the ùíû theorem that constrains renormalization group flows of quantum field theories in diverse dimensions.

        Colloquium: Fractional electromagnetism in quantum matter and high-energy physics
      </a>
      <br>
      Gabriele La Nave, Kridsanaphong Limtragool, and Philip W. Phillips
      <p>
        A theory of fractional electricity and magnetism is presented here which is capable of describing phenomena as disparate as the nonlocality of the Pippard kernel in superconductivity and anomalous dimensions for conserved currents in holographic dilatonic models. While it is a standard result in field theory that the scaling dimension of conserved currents and their associated gauge fields are determined strictly by dimensional analysis and hence cannot change under any amount of renormalization, it is also the case that the standard conservation laws for currents, ùëë‚Å¢ùêΩ=0, remain unchanged in form if any differential operator that commutes with the total exterior derivative, [ùëë,
        ^
        ùëå
        ]=0, multiplies the current. Such an operator, effectively changing the dimension of the current, increases the allowable gauge transformations in electromagnetism and is at the heart of N√∂ther‚Äôs second theorem. However, this observation has not been exploited to generate new electromagnetisms. Here a consistent theory of electromagnetism is developed that exploits this hidden redundancy in which the standard gauge symmetry in electromagnetism is modified by the rotationally invariant operator, the fractional Laplacian. The resultant theories are shown to all allow for anomalous (nontraditional) scaling dimensions of the gauge field and the associated current. Using the Caffarelli-Silvestre theorem [Caffarelli, L., and L. Silvestre, 2007, Commun. Partial Differ. Equations 32, 1245.], its extension [La Nave, G., and P. Phillips, 2017, arXiv:1708.00863 [Commun. Math. Phys. (in press)]‚Äâ] to ùëù forms and the membrane paradigm, either the boundary (UV) or horizon (IR) theory of holographic dilatonic models are shown to both be described by such fractional electromagnetic theories. The nonlocal Pippard kernel introduced to solve the problem of the Meissner effect in elemental superconductors can also be formulated as a special case of fractional electromagnetism. Because the holographic dilatonic models produce boundary theories that are equivalent to those arising from a bulk theory with a massive gauge field along the radial direction, the common thread linking both of these problems is the breaking of ùëà‚Å°(1) symmetry down to ‚Ñ§2. The standard charge quantization rules fail when the gauge field acquires an anomalous dimension. The breakdown of charge quantization is discussed extensively in terms of the experimentally measurable modified Aharonov-Bohm effect in the strange metal phase of the cuprate superconductors.      </p>

      An Introduction to Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
    </a>
    <br>
    Aron J. Beekman, Louk Rademaker, Jasper van Wezel
    <p>
      Perhaps the most important aspect of symmetry in physics is the idea that a state does not need to have the same symmetries as the theory that describes it. This phenomenon is known as spontaneous symmetry breaking. In these lecture notes, starting from a careful definition of symmetry in physics, we introduce symmetry breaking and its consequences. Emphasis is placed on the physics of singular limits, showing the reality of symmetry breaking even in small-sized systems. Topics covered include Nambu-Goldstone modes, quantum corrections, phase transitions, topological defects and gauge fields. We provide many examples from both high energy and condensed matter physics. These notes are suitable for graduate students.    </p>
